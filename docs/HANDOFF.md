# Handoff — 2026-09-29

**Start here.** `CLAUDE.md` is the stable how-it-works. This file is only: where we are, what to do
next, what will bite you, and how to work with the owner. It was rewritten from scratch on
2026-09-29; the previous one, with every session log since 2026-09-24, is
`docs/archive/HANDOFF_to_2026-09-29.md` - read it only when chasing the history of something.

**Keep it short.** A finished investigation goes to `docs/LESSONS.md` (general) or
`docs/display/history.md` (display) as a few lines; a test run goes to its test log; a number goes
to the doc that owns it. This file says where things are, not how they got there.

## Where the project is

**`v0.2.7` tagged 2026-09-24** (through milestone 2.7). Since then, all on `main`: #58 screenshots,
and **2.9's display stack on six of nine boards** (merge `75a43c8`, 2026-09-29).

What a board does: boots into two pages (House = the owner's 18 HA entities over the websocket,
Fleet = MQTT/system/virtual cards), swiped with wrap-around; three colour schemes (Midnight
default, Fleet, Linen with real shadows); card types with state icons; an FPS/CPU overlay;
`/screenshot` and `/bench` over HTTP.

## What is next — the new session's job

**The design interview, then 2.10 (#65).** The owner wants the next session to focus on 2.10 and
what follows, not the display.

1. **Run the interview**: `docs/design/interview-phase2-3.md`. Its §0.1a is the protocol - read it
   first. It produces the blueprint for 2.8, 2.10, 2.11 and Phase 3. §1 item 10 holds the owner's
   notes from glass on 2026-09-29 (Linen card fill, a more visible Wi-Fi icon, chrome text too small
   -> #73, hero value size per grid, rotation as a setting -> #71) - bring them in, do not re-ask.
2. **2.10 card popup groundwork (#65)** - design drafted in `docs/design/card-sheet.md` (draft 2),
   decisions D1-D7 in its §10 are blocking.
3. Then **2.8 header slots (#19)** - battery glyphs already designed (artifact "Fleet Status
   Glyphs", linked on #19), data from #72. Then **2.11 group cards (#66)**, then **3.1 schema (#20)**.

ROADMAP §7 has the same order.

## Fires still burning — each has an owner doc or issue, none needs the next session

| What | State | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Battery** | **prototype merged** (`a283fd0`, 2026-09-30). Everything current: **`docs/design/power-battery.md`**. Runs only with `-D HAS_BATTERY` (7B, 4880). Voltage good; the inferred power state works for charging / on battery (P1-P3 pass) but cannot see a missing cell while USB is present (P5 fail). **Owner's direction: do not perfect the inference; fuel gauges (MAX17043, ordered) on the units that carry a battery.** Also open: the AXP2101 on the S3_4B, a power-state entity for the header (#19) | #72 |
| **2.9 last boards** | `CYD_S3_8048`, `WS_S3_5B` to move to esp_lcd when on the desk; then #67 closes | #67, `docs/display/README.md` |
| **4B panel timing** | S3_4B clean after `C2 31 02`; P4_4B faint lines at the right edge on the log page. 7-day watch | #69 |
| **S3 LVGL speed** | S3_4B feels heavier since LVGL's pool moved to PSRAM. Paused by the owner; resume soon | #70 (full reasoning in its comments) |
| Rotation setting / IMU | recorded | #71 |
| Fonts / type ladder | recorded, feeds the interview | #73 |

**Branch rule (owner, 2026-09-29): branch every piece of work off `main` and merge it when done.**
The display work became a four-deep stack and forced unfinished work into `main` with the finished.
Never start a branch on an unmerged one without asking.

## Boards on the desk

| Board | Port | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `WS_P4_5` | COM15 (CH343) | dev board; **screwed into its enclosure** - no battery test |
| `WS_P4_4B` | COM7 (CH343) | |
| `WS_P4_7B` | COM6 (native USB) | **needs two USB cables** or it browns out on boot |
| `CYD_P4_1060` | COM9 | also needs two cables |
| `CYD_P4_4880` | COM19 (native USB) | LiPo fitted; browned out on the PC's USB alone |
| `WS_S3_4B` | COM8 (CH343) | the slow dev target; `Serial` is native USB, not the CH343 |
| `CYD_S3_3248` | - | **USB broken** (2026-09-28); out of commission |
| `CYD_S3_8048`, `WS_S3_5B` | - | not plugged in |

Ports move when boards are re-plugged; identify a board by its USB serial:
`Get-CimInstance Win32_PnPEntity | ? Name -match 'COM\d+' | select Name, DeviceID`.
**Is a board alive?** Ask Home Assistant (`sensor.<device>_uptime`), not the cable.
Dev boards while developing: **`WS_P4_5` + `WS_S3_4B`**; all nine only before a merge.

**RTC backup cells:** the three Waveshare P4s need **rechargeable** cells (the 7B's holder is ML1220
size - not a CR1220). S3_5B's 927 holder is unconfirmed. Nothing reads an RTC yet. #32.

## Read in this order

1. `CLAUDE.md` — the HAL/BSP, the token and paint rules, **and the file-editing rule at the top**.
2. `docs/LESSONS.md` — before debugging anything.
3. For UI work: `docs/design/interview-phase2-3.md`, `card-sheet.md`, `cards.md` §13, `pages.md`,
   `card-layout.md` (before moving anything inside a card), `tokens.md`, `dashboard.md`,
   `ha-websocket.md`, `startup.md`.
4. For the display: `docs/display/README.md` only - it indexes the rest.
5. `docs/ROADMAP.md` §7.

## Environment state git cannot see

**The ESP32-P4 framework libraries are REBUILT, not stock.** `esp32p4_es` in
`~/.platformio/packages/framework-arduinoespressif32-libs/` carries `MEMPOOL_PREFER_SPIRAM` and a
64-byte L2 line - the fix for esp-hosted-mcu#243 (#49). The stock copy sits beside it as
`esp32p4_es.stock.55.03.311`; rollback is a rename. A `pio pkg update` or platform reinstall
silently puts the bug back. `docs/REBUILD_P4_LIBS.md`. The S3 libraries are stock.

**Do not use NINA's C6 updater** - it hung `WS_P4_5`.

`reference/datasheets/` (ST7701S, ST7703) is gitignored, like the rest of `reference/`.

## Things that will bite you

- **Build from PowerShell, not Git Bash** - pioarduino rejects MSYS shells.
- **`pio run` with no `-e` builds ONE environment** (the default, the 7B). The all-nine gate is
  `pio run -e X -e Y ...` and takes ~30 minutes: run it detached (`Start-Process`) so a tool
  timeout cannot kill it.
- **Clear `.pio/build_cache` after a BSP, struct-layout or `lv_conf.h` edit.** Stale objects
  against a changed struct corrupt memory rather than failing.
- **Do not edit source while a build runs** - it compiles the half-finished edit. Docs are safe.
- **Never set build flags through `PLATFORMIO_BUILD_FLAGS`** - it wiped `.pio/build` mid-build. Put
  them in `platformio.ini`.
- **`PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` before any `pio` whose output you pipe**, or it dies silently.
- **Native-USB boards and a PC:** `Serial.setTxTimeoutMs(0)` in `main.cpp` is what stops them
  freezing when the port is held open unread. Do not remove it.
- **A serial monitor resets the board when it opens.** Attach with `--rts 0 --dtr 0`, or read the
  board through HA or `/screenshot`. PlatformIO's own Python has pyserial:
  `~/.platformio/penv/Scripts/python.exe`.
- **Prefer ESP-IDF facilities to Arduino-only ones** (owner). HTTP handlers run on their own task:
  never touch LVGL from one. HaProvider receives on the websocket task: never touch LVGL there.
- **`Edit` on a CRLF file**: deleting a line by matching a leading newline joins two lines.
- **LVGL clips children to their parent** - use `UI::unclipShadows()`. **Never toggle HIDDEN on a
  screen-sized object when an animation starts.** Anything drawn stays ASCII, except `°`.
- **Verify from outside the device** - the router, the broker, HA, `/bench?what=verify`. The
  project's oldest rule.

## How to work with this owner

A hobbyist and ESP32 enthusiast, not a professional developer, and explicit about that - but reads
code, spots real bugs, and has caught several that were not obvious. **Treat the owner's instincts
as data.** A little colour-blind: never distinguish two states by colour alone.

**What works:**
- **Show, don't spec.** Build something to react to; the owner flashes fast and tests
  thoroughly, test by test against a sheet with PASS/FAIL criteria.
- **Plain language, not metaphor** ("sometimes I get a little lost in the slang").
- **Never assume. Give the top 2-3 options with a recommendation, and ask** before building on an
  assumption; discuss a structural choice a turn before implementing it.
- **Read the tool, not the name.** Check the source or the datasheet before asserting behaviour.
- **Own mistakes plainly.** Report negative results as clearly as wins, and say what has NOT been
  tested - the owner acts on it immediately.
- **Say what to expect** before anything that changes the screen - a benchmark freezes it for
  seconds; over a minute is a problem.
- **"I'm wondering whether..." is usually a design instinct** - engage with it.
- **Say plainly what is unexplained**; the owner often finds the answer (#49 ended that way).
- **Avoid compacting context**: the owner would rather end a session with a clean handoff.

**What to avoid:**
- Committing straight to `main`. Feature branch off `main`, `--no-ff` merge once signed off.
- Guessing a fourth time. Instrument it or ask the far end.
- Claiming a script worked because it printed something. Assert the anchor, then check the file.

**Versioning:** `A.B.C.D`, where C is the milestone within the phase. Tag on `main` at merge when a
milestone completes, never during development. D is commits since the tag; a dirty tree appends
`+dirty`.

**The issue tracker is yours to manage**, and keeping it, HANDOFF and ROADMAP current is part of the
work, not a follow-up.
